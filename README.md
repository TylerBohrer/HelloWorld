# Labs
Adding my labs with a format that will most likely be changed throughout the year.     
All the labs will include what will be needed for each to be able to be used.   

#Lab1
In this lab I go over how to set a cluster up in hadoop. 

#Lab2
In this lab I go over how to install weka and use some of its most basic features.

#Lab3
In this lab I use java with weka to test whether there was a network anomaly or not.

#Lab4
This lab goes over how to convert image colors to rgb and test if they are the same through weka.
